<p>So, I use <a href="https://www.zerotier.com">ZeroTier </a>as my Layer 2 Mesh network between VMs and Physical hosts, and this morning I got a message telling me I was sending non allowed traffic over the <a href="https://www.de-cix.com">DE-CIX</a> VLAN&#8230; This was news to me, but after some digging, and help from Marek over at <a href="https://cp.vserver.site/aff.php?aff=16">Vserver.Site</a>, i managed to find out it was ZeroTier traffic causing the problem. ZeroTier in its nature will try and use all NICs on a machine to find an internet connection&#8230; but if you are on a peering VLAN, you do not want this to happen&#8230;</p>



<p>So, after more digging, I found the &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/service">Local Configuration File</a>&#8221; in ZeroTier. This includes some features I did not know about, including how to place Subnets and Interfaces into the &#8220;Black List&#8221; so they wont be used by ZeroTier. </p>



<p>I wont reproduce the config file here, but i will give some tips, and explain what i have done. First, on Debian and Ubuntu, the file lives in <code>/var/lib/zerotier-one/local.conf</code>. If the file does not exist, you can create it. Its a standard JSON file. What i ended up adding was an IP range for each IX the box was connected to  and marked it as black listed. Under settings, i also set the <code>interfacePrefixBlacklist </code>with a list of the interfaces connected to the IXes. an example is below:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiernano/59893743403c57e073edefffb0cfe237.js"></script>



<p>This is the example for my machine connected to <a href="http://www.de-cix.net">DE-CIX</a>. ens19, 20 and 21 are connected to the peering VLANs on <a href="https://muc.de-cix.net/">Munich</a>, <a href="https://dus.de-cix.net/">Dusseldorf</a> and <a href="https://ham.de-cix.net/">Hamburg</a>.   Given I have stopped sending bad IPv6 traffic, my guess then is the  <code>interfacePrefixBlacklist</code> is only required, but I added the IPs also, just in case&#8230; I should probably include V6 here too&#8230; </p>



<p>When you make those changes, a restart of  the ZeroTier service is required. And that is that. After Merak did some checks, and he was happy it was fixed, I was allowed back on the IX&#8230; Marek When you make those changes, a restart of  the ZeroTier service is required. And that is that.

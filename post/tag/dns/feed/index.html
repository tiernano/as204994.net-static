<p>I was looking for a nice and somewhat simple way of managing my Reverse DNS settings, and I think i found it. I use <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol">DNSControl</a> for managing all my DNS records for all (30+) domains, so i decided to see if I could get it to work for my Reverse (PTR) records too&#8230; and it works!</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol">DNSControl</a> is a project from the <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> Guys and Gals, that allows easy enough managing of your DNS records. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once your over that, your laughing! </p>



<p>Second, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Route53</a> is Amazon&#8217;s DNS service, as part of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>. You can use it for AWS internal specific stuff, DNS resolution for your public domains, or, in my case, a reverse DNS for my IP block. I also use it for a private DNS for my ZeroTier network too, but that&#8217;s a separate matter&#8230;</p>



<p>So, to get them both hooked up, first you need DNSControl configured. They have <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/">extensive documentation on the matter</a>, so check that out, as i wont be going into too much detail on that part.</p>



<p>After creating a record in Route53 on the AWS portal, my credentials file with details for Route53, creating a &#8220;noreg&#8221; record, etc, i then created the reverse domain for my IP range:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiernano/8c9b8d8091c84612aaa25a6cf8bf12f3.js"></script>



<p><code>REV('185.186.67.0/24') </code>is a custom block that will automagically create the correct record, which in my case would be <code>67.186.185.in-addr.arpa</code>. you could leave that in there, but if you have a few, it may be prone to &#8220;fat fingering&#8221; the records&#8230; </p>



<p>Next, you have all your PTR records. each one has the last part of the IP, along with the name of it. Once you have all your records, it is then a matter of pushing to Route53 using DNSControl: </p>



<p><code>./dnscontrol-Darwin preview --domains 67.186.185.in-addr.arpa</code></p>



<p>will show you what changes have been made, assuming you have the config correct.</p>



<p><code>./dnscontrol-Darwin push --domains 67.186.185.in-addr.arpa</code></p>



<p>will do the actual pushing.</p>



<p>It is then just a matter of making sure you have the correct records pointing at the correct DNS servers, as per the <a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/support/configuring-reverse-dns">RIPE (or other provider&#8217;s) documentation</a>. And that is that. A quick &#8220;dig&#8221; on the command line shows your work:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiernano/a7b3ba53ca8779828a3e3df84b7fcd4f.js"></script>



<p>That should be it! happy days! and in theory, since the config file is &#8220;just&#8221; Javascript, you could pull it from a DB, a IPAM such as <a href="https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Netbox</a>, or some other place. Thats my next challenge&#8230;</p>

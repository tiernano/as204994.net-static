      <description>Peering Info is available on Peering DB or you can email me at peering [AT] as204994 [dot] net.
Our peering policy is Open.  Peers may only send traffic to destinations announced by AS204994. Peers may only send traffic originating from their own / customer networks. Peers are not allowed to point static routes towards AS204994. Peers must operate a NOC which is reachable by phone or email. Peers should cooperate in any case of abuse.</description>

      <description>AS204994 spans 5 countries (Ireland, UK, Germany, Amsterdam and USA), with 5 servers from 4 providers (3 from Vultr, 1 from VServer.site and 1 from Packet.Net) and some on-prem machines (mix of VMs and Physical routers and machines). this may change over time, so check the homepage
Upstream providers are listed on the homepage also, but in house I use Virgin Media Business broadband and from there tunnel back to the upstream servers using ZeroTier.</description>

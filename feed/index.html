<p>So, I use <a href="https://www.zerotier.com">ZeroTier </a>as my Layer 2 Mesh network between VMs and Physical hosts, and this morning I got a message telling me I was sending non allowed traffic over the <a href="https://www.de-cix.com">DE-CIX</a> VLAN&#8230; This was news to me, but after some digging, and help from Marek over at <a href="https://cp.vserver.site/aff.php?aff=16">Vserver.Site</a>, i managed to find out it was ZeroTier traffic causing the problem. ZeroTier in its nature will try and use all NICs on a machine to find an internet connection&#8230; but if you are on a peering VLAN, you do not want this to happen&#8230;</p>



<p>So, after more digging, I found the &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/service">Local Configuration File</a>&#8221; in ZeroTier. This includes some features I did not know about, including how to place Subnets and Interfaces into the &#8220;Black List&#8221; so they wont be used by ZeroTier. </p>



<p>I wont reproduce the config file here, but i will give some tips, and explain what i have done. First, on Debian and Ubuntu, the file lives in <code>/var/lib/zerotier-one/local.conf</code>. If the file does not exist, you can create it. Its a standard JSON file. What i ended up adding was an IP range for each IX the box was connected to  and marked it as black listed. Under settings, i also set the <code>interfacePrefixBlacklist </code>with a list of the interfaces connected to the IXes. an example is below:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiernano/59893743403c57e073edefffb0cfe237.js"></script>



<p>This is the example for my machine connected to <a href="http://www.de-cix.net">DE-CIX</a>. ens19, 20 and 21 are connected to the peering VLANs on <a href="https://muc.de-cix.net/">Munich</a>, <a href="https://dus.de-cix.net/">Dusseldorf</a> and <a href="https://ham.de-cix.net/">Hamburg</a>.   Given I have stopped sending bad IPv6 traffic, my guess then is the  <code>interfacePrefixBlacklist</code> is only required, but I added the IPs also, just in case&#8230; I should probably include V6 here too&#8230; </p>



<p>When you make those changes, a restart of  the ZeroTier service is required. And that is that. After Merak did some checks, and he was happy it was fixed, I was allowed back on the IX&#8230; Marek When you make those changes, a restart of  the ZeroTier service is required. And that is that.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I was looking for a nice and somewhat simple way of managing my Reverse DNS settings, and I think i found it. I use <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol">DNSControl</a> for managing all my DNS records for all (30+) domains, so i decided to see if I could get it to work for my Reverse (PTR) records too&#8230; and it works!</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol">DNSControl</a> is a project from the <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> Guys and Gals, that allows easy enough managing of your DNS records. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once your over that, your laughing! </p>



<p>Second, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Route53</a> is Amazon&#8217;s DNS service, as part of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>. You can use it for AWS internal specific stuff, DNS resolution for your public domains, or, in my case, a reverse DNS for my IP block. I also use it for a private DNS for my ZeroTier network too, but that&#8217;s a separate matter&#8230;</p>



<p>So, to get them both hooked up, first you need DNSControl configured. They have <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/">extensive documentation on the matter</a>, so check that out, as i wont be going into too much detail on that part.</p>



<p>After creating a record in Route53 on the AWS portal, my credentials file with details for Route53, creating a &#8220;noreg&#8221; record, etc, i then created the reverse domain for my IP range:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiernano/8c9b8d8091c84612aaa25a6cf8bf12f3.js"></script>



<p><code>REV('185.186.67.0/24') </code>is a custom block that will automagically create the correct record, which in my case would be <code>67.186.185.in-addr.arpa</code>. you could leave that in there, but if you have a few, it may be prone to &#8220;fat fingering&#8221; the records&#8230; </p>



<p>Next, you have all your PTR records. each one has the last part of the IP, along with the name of it. Once you have all your records, it is then a matter of pushing to Route53 using DNSControl: </p>



<p><code>./dnscontrol-Darwin preview --domains 67.186.185.in-addr.arpa</code></p>



<p>will show you what changes have been made, assuming you have the config correct.</p>



<p><code>./dnscontrol-Darwin push --domains 67.186.185.in-addr.arpa</code></p>



<p>will do the actual pushing.</p>



<p>It is then just a matter of making sure you have the correct records pointing at the correct DNS servers, as per the <a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/db/support/configuring-reverse-dns">RIPE (or other provider&#8217;s) documentation</a>. And that is that. A quick &#8220;dig&#8221; on the command line shows your work:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiernano/a7b3ba53ca8779828a3e3df84b7fcd4f.js"></script>



<p>That should be it! happy days! and in theory, since the config file is &#8220;just&#8221; Javascript, you could pull it from a DB, a IPAM such as <a href="https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Netbox</a>, or some other place. Thats my next challenge&#8230;</p>

<p>So, a while back, I used Tinc for as a mesh VPN network. Tinc, for the uninitiated, is as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunnelling and encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet </p><cite><a href="https://www.tinc-vpn.org">tinc-vpn.org</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Its been a while, but i noticed that they did have a version 1.1 preview, and did some tests with it previouly, and seen some decient perf with it. But, due to a mix of laziness, testing and more laziness, i ended up on ZeroTier for my internal peering network&#8230; </p>



<p>Now, however, i am starting to look at other options. This post will explain how to build Tinc 1.1 preview on Ubuntu 18.04. I will look into other options later on&#8230;</p>



<p>First, this will not be a configuration of Tinc&#8230; I am only building it.</p>



<p>You need to install some Apt Packages for the build to run:</p>



<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>



<p><code>sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev libreadline6-dev libzlcore-dev zlib1g-dev liblzo2-dev libssl-dev</code></p>



<p>next, download the source and extract it:</p>



<p><code>wget https://www.tinc-vpn.org/packages/tinc-1.1pre17.tar.gz</code></p>



<p><code>tar -zxvf  tinc-1.1pre17.tar.gz</code></p>



<p><code>cd  tinc-1.1pre17</code></p>



<p>next, configure and build. </p>



<p><code>./configure</code></p>



<p><code>make -j5</code></p>



<p>I use -j5 to use all 4 cores on my machine + 1 (its something i read years ago and i keep doing this). Just change that number as required.</p>



<p>Now your done. you can do a <code>sudo  make install</code> to install in the required folders, or just run it from where its build. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>AS204994 spans 5 countries (Ireland, UK, Germany, Amsterdam and USA), with 5 servers from 4 providers (3 from <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6925432">Vultr</a>, 1 from <a href="https://cp.vserver.site/aff.php?aff=16">VServer.site</a> and 1 from <a href="https://www.packet.net/">Packet.Net</a>) and some on-prem machines (mix of VMs and Physical routers and machines). this may change over time, so check the <a href="https://as204994.net/">homepage</a></p>



<p>Upstream providers are listed on the <a href="https://as204994.net/">homepage</a> also, but in house I use <a href="https://www.virginmedia.ie/business/business-broadband-phone/">Virgin Media Business broadband</a> and from there tunnel back to the upstream servers using <a href="https://www.zerotier.com/">ZeroTier</a>. I also connect to <a href="https://evix.org/">EVIX</a> over ZeroTier and to both <a href="https://www.locix.online/">LocIX</a> and <a href="http://kleyrex.net/">KleyReX</a> with the VM in <a href="https://cp.vserver.site/aff.php?aff=16">VServer.site</a>.</p>



<p>Once the connection is made, I use&nbsp;<a href="https://bird.network.cz/">Bird</a>&nbsp;BGP to announce and receive routes from each of the providers. This is done as follows:</p>



<ul><li>I have a /24 block of IPs announced though Vultr, Packet, VServer.Site and also though each of the IXs I’m connected to. Currently I am only using V4 to try and get this sorted first, then will add my /48 V6 space to the mix.</li><li>the /24 is split into a /28 for “internal peering” (ZeroTier network), a /28 for Any cast stuff (websites hosted across multiple sites, etc), a /27 for the house and multiple /28s, one for each of the VMs.</li><li>Any upstream VM that gets a full (or even partial) route feed announces all those routes (bar some filtered routes) back to Dublin. It also announces the /28 it has back to all other (internal) VMs. Only the /24 is announced to the upstream.</li><li>If a provider does not give any routes back, we leave it as is. It will still announce its internal /28 back to the rest of the network.</li><li>All servers also run a copy of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGinx</a>&nbsp;which then hosts any of the anycast websites (<a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/">tiernanotoole.ie</a>&nbsp;currently being the main one). That site is “hidden” behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>&nbsp;for their security and bandwidth/caching features.</li><li>In house, all routes are managed by a single Ubuntu VM running on Hyper-V. It has a main internet connection with Virgin Media, and then connects internally to the rest of the network. Its set to allow internal routing, and the /27 for the house is connected to an internal VLAN.</li><li>I have a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter POE connected to that VLAN and it gets multiple of those IPs. Workstations, phones, etc, the connect to it and use it as a connection to the internet.</li></ul>



<p>So far, this works about 90% of the time. This is not currently the production network: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc, wont work, so all media devices go direct to the internet over a different VLAN (Luckily Virgin Media Business gave me a /29 to use). There is some work that will need to be done before it can go full production. Ideally, if I could announce my V4 and V6 though Virgin Media, that would make life easier, but we will see if they can sort it out.</p>



<p>So, Any questions? You can mail me at Tiernan [at] as204994 [dot] net.</p>
